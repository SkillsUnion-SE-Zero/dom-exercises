# DOM Exercises

This repository contains 9 javascipt exercises for DOM 

Setup: 
- Fork and clone this repo
- cd into the cloned repo
- run npm install

Take a couple of minutes to explore index.html
Open index.html in the browser and compare what you see in
the browser with the contents of the html file. 

Peek into the exercises directory. This is where the 9 tasks are
kept along with their tests. 
It is recommended to do the exercises in order. 

Open the first exercise, read the instructions and run
the test script in your terminal in the project directory level. 

For example, to test the first exercise run 

`npm test exercises/1-findElement`

You should see an output that looks something like this:
```
  Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 total
  Tests:       3 failed, 3 total
  Snapshots:   0 total
```

Scroll up in the terminal until you see:
```
  ✕ Returns element by tag 
  ✕ Returns element by class 
  ✕ Returns element by complex selector
```
This is the summary of which tests are passing and
which tests are failing. 

Given output means that there are 3 tests and all 3 are failing.

Below you should see output for why the tests are failing. 

Try to implement `findElement` function while running the
tests often. 

You are successful when there is a green tick in front of the test.

You can move on to the next exercise when all of the 
tests have green ticks.

Also, take a moment explore the tests. You will notice that the description
for each test and the number of them matches with the 
output in your terminal. 

You can use index.js to try and manually test your methods
with the given html file.
