/*
  Write a javascript function processInput which
  adds a click event listener to an element
  with id="submit". When the event fires we 
  we should render this message within "submit-confirmation" element.

  processInput should attach an event listener to
  #submit button

  "
    NAME, Thank you for getting in touch! 
    Please expect a response within 3 working days
    on this email: EMAIL
  "

  Where NAME and EMAIL represent the information the user has
  inserted name and email inputs

  If this method is correctly implemented and called in index.js 
  you should see output similar to process-input-example.png after 
  User has added name and email and clicked "Send message" button
