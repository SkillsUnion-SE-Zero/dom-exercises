/*
  Write a function addClient which renders 
  the given name and logo to the page within the 
  div with id attribute "clients"

  addClient should return undefined 
  but when calling it with name and image url parameters
  you should be able to see that name and image
  displayed on Clients page.

  Furthermore, addClient function should not overwrite 
  existing client information on the page

  Example: 
    addClient("TeamSkills", "https://picsum.photos/id/1/200/300")
    should render TeamSkills and the image to Clients page

    You are welcome to try it out with index.js and see the change 
    in html. 
    Please have a look at the expected output in add-client-example.png 
    when addClient iscorrectly implemented and called from index.js
